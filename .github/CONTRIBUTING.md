# Contributing to ED Dates CK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ED Dates CK! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code to and from our internal repository. We'll use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows our coding standards.
6. Update the changelog.

### Coding Standards

- Follow WordPress coding standards

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code

    * ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
